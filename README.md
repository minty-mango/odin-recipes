# odin-recipes

This is the first project repository for The Odin Project.

We will be making a basic recipe website with the current
tools we have learned. We will use the combination of previous
lessons and apply it to this project.

Some steps:
* Create our first project repository
* Create a main page
* Create subsequent pages with different recipes on it
* Link those webpages to the main webpage
* Add in images

This will not include:
* CSS 
* JS 

Elements we will be using:
* Unordered List `<ul>`
* Orderered List `<ol>`
* Images `<img>`
* Links to relative webpages `<a href>`
* Paragraphs `<p>`
